# Covid19_ExpertSystem
An expert system for diagnosing covid-19 based on the symptoms that patients report

In this project,the purpose is to diagnose covid-19 or other similar diseases like the flue and cold according to the symptoms that each patient has. 
In the first step, an implementation of ID3 algorithm which is specific to this problem trains over a dataset of patients and their symptoms and the final diagnosis
in order to obtain an optimal decision tree. 
The dataset used here is a small sample with only 10 patients and the final decision tree looks like the following:

Then,the rules in the knowledgebase are created base on the decision tree and we can consult with the system.
a simple test run is shown below:
